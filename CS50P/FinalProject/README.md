# Windows and Weather
## Zac Walker | CS50P Final Project Submission
#### Demonstration of the program:  <URL HERE>
#### Why this program:
Have you ever ended up in that "angry dad mode" because you accidentally left your windows open and now your A/C is cooling down the neighborhood? Who hasn't?

This Windows and Weather program provides a well-needed cure for the angry dad mode by notifying the user, both in the console and via text message, that they need to open or close the windows in their house. Simple summary: It takes in user inputs for their location, desired home temperature, frequency of checking the weather, and phone number - and the program does the rest. No longer do you need to stress and worry about whether you are dumping glorious cold air straight out your windows!
